# LSTM/RNN Based Neural Network to predict the singular/plural usage of a verb for a sentence. i.e Subject Verb agreement

A RNN/LSTM sequence model should be learn the subject of a sentence as well as the singular/plural nature of verb.

We use Linzen et al.'s dataset. https://tallinzen.net/media/rnn_agreement/

## Code contains:
### 1) Adam Optimiser, Cross-Entropy Loss based Pytorch LSTM Model.
### 2) Experiments on Test set with 96% Accuract
### 3) PCA visualisation of singular/plural words
